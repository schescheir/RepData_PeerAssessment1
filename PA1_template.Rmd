Peer Assessment Project 1- Reproducible Research
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document that will be used to completed Peer Assessment Project #1 for the Coursera Class "Reproducible Research."

The responses for this will be follow the evaluation tool inorder to more easily be evaluated by you, the evaluator.  Different sections will be identifed with astrixes (****).  

**** Reading and Processing  ****

This reads the .csv file into R and then (since the assignment asks us to ignore missing values), omits observations that have a NA value for steps.

```{r}
wal <- read.csv("activity.csv")
walk <- na.omit(wal)
```

**** Histogram  ****

```{r} 
hwalk <- tapply(walk$steps, walk$date, sum)
hist(hwalk)
```


**** Mean and Median ****

Mean
```{r}
tapply(walk$steps, walk$date, mean)
```

Median
```{r}
tapply(walk$steps, walk$date, median)
```

**** Time series plot **** 

```{r}
twalk <- tapply(walk$steps, walk$interval, mean)
plot(levels(factor(walk$interval)), twalk, type = "l")
```

****  Point with maximum number of average (mean) steps per interval. **** 

To do this we used the which.max command.  The top is the begining of the interval and the section is the factor levlel associated with that interval.

```{r}
which.max(twalk)
```

**** Imputing missing values. **** 

The decision has been made to input all missing values with the median daily value for that day.  However there is an issue.  For 8 days the median is NA.  This is because for those days there are NO measured values through out the day, and thus, after NA's have been omitted they have zero value.  To deal with that those days much first be removed from the data set:

To this end days that were found to be NA after NA values were removed were idetified.  The were then isolated.  The labels for these values were then found and subsetted out of the original dataframe (before removal of na's as done by na.omit during processing).

The dates that now were removed were subsequently removed as factors.

```{r}
swalk <- tapply(walk$steps, walk$date, median)
nswalk <- is.na(swalk)
toBeRemoved <- which(nswalk == TRUE)
brbr <- labels(toBeRemoved)
brbr
walk2 <-wal
for(i in 1:8) {  
     walk2 <-subset(walk2, date != brbr[i])
     walk2
}
walk2$date <- as.factor(as.character(walk2$date))
walk <- walk2
```

Next the median of the remaining days was taken:

```{r}
tapply(walk$steps, walk$date, median)
```

And all medians were found to be zero.  As such remaining NA's were replaced with 0's.  While there are no more NA values that was accomplished by:

```{r}
walk2[is.na(walk2)] <- 0
```

****  Histogram of post-NA replacement **** 

```{r} 
hwalk2 <- tapply(walk2$steps, walk2$date, sum)
hist(hwalk2)
```

****  Weekdays and Weekends **** 

Firstly we need to convert the date column to date.  Then assign them the day of the week.  Then create two data frames, ones with weekends days and one with week day days.  

```{r} 
walk2$date <- as.Date(walk2$date)
walk2$wkdy <-weekdays(walk2$date)
walk2s <- subset(walk2, walk2$wkdy == "Sunday")
walk2ss <- subset(walk2, walk2$wkdy == "Saturday")
walk2weekends <- rbind(walk2s, walk2ss)
walk2m <- subset(walk2, walk2$wkdy == "Monday")
walk2t <- subset(walk2, walk2$wkdy == "Tuesday")
walk2w <- subset(walk2, walk2$wkdy == "Wednesday")
walk2th <- subset(walk2, walk2$wkdy == "Thursday")
walk2f <- subset(walk2, walk2$wkdy == "Friday")
walk2weekdays <- rbind(walk2m, walk2t, walk2w, walk2th, walk2f)
```

Then we need to find the averages and make the graphs.

```{r}
twalkwd <- tapply(walk2weekdays$steps, walk2weekdays$interval, mean)
twalkwe <- tapply(walk2weekends$steps, walk2weekends$interval, mean)

par(mfrow =c(1,2))
plot(levels(factor(walk2weekends$interval)), twalkwe, type = "l", main= "Weekends", xlab = "Intervals", ylab = "Steps")
plot(levels(factor(walk2weekdays$interval)), twalkwd, type = "l", main= "Weekdays", xlab = "Intervals", ylab = "Steps")
```
